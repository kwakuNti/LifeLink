            <h2>The Importance of Kidney Donation</h2>
            <p>Kidney donation represents one of the most common and successful organ transplant procedures. Unlike many other organs, kidneys can be donated by living donors, as humans can live healthy lives with just one kidney. This unique characteristic makes kidney donation particularly important in addressing the growing need for organ transplants.</p>
